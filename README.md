## About GTAS
The Global Travel Assessment System (GTAS) is web application for improving border security. It enables government agencies to automate the identification of high-risk air travelers in advance of their intended travel. 

The United Nations has called upon members to use Advance Passenger Information (API) and Passenger Name Record (PNR) data for preventing the movement of high-risk travelers, and GTAS was designed to give every country that capability. The World Customs Organization (WCO) has partnered with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (US-CBP) because of the shared belief that every border security agency should have access to the latest tools. US-CBP has made this repository avaialble to the WCO to facilite deployment for its member states.

This belief has become a reality with GTAS in production. It is able to handle the load of a high-volume country, and has successfully identified high-risk travelers. The mission GTAS supports goes beyond combating terrorism and includes;

* Preventing the spread of human health outbreaks
* Protecting wildlife by preventing the transport of illegal animal products
* Finding missing persons
* Fighting drug trade
* Protecting agriculture

Which results in;

* Safer travel
* Expedited Screening of passengers
* Less waiting time at airports

GTAS accomplishes these goals through providing all the necessary decision support system features to 
(1) receive and store air traveler data
(2) provide real-time risk assessment against this data based on your own specific risk criteria and/or watch lists
(3) view high risk travelers, their associated flight and reservation information, and possible affiliates
